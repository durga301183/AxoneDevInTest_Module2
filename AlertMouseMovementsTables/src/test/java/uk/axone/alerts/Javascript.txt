java.lang.Object executeScript(java.lang.String script,
                               java.lang.Object... args)
Executes JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. The script fragment provided will be executed as the body of an anonymous function.
Within the script, use document to refer to the current document. Note that local variables will not be available once the script has finished executing, though global variables will persist.

If the script has a return value (i.e. if the script contains a return statement), then the following steps will be taken:

For an HTML element, this method returns a WebElement
For a decimal, a Double is returned
For a non-decimal number, a Long is returned
For a boolean, a Boolean is returned
For all other cases, a String is returned.
For an array, return a List<Object> with each object following the rules above. We support nested lists.
For a map, return a Map<String, Object> with values following the rules above.
Unless the value is null or there is no return value, in which null is returned
Arguments must be a number, a boolean, a String, WebElement, or a List of any combination of the above. An exception will be thrown if the arguments do not meet these criteria. The arguments will be made available to the JavaScript via the "arguments" magic variable, as if the function were called via "Function.apply"

Parameters:
script - The JavaScript to execute
args - The arguments to the script. May be empty
Returns:
One of Boolean, Long, Double, String, List, Map or WebElement. Or null.
