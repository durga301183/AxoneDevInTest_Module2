Reason	Cause/fix
TIMEOUT	The session timed out because the client did not access it within the timeout. If the client has been somehow suspended, this may happen when it wakes up
BROWSER_TIMEOUT	The node timed out the browser because it was hanging for too long (parameter browserTimeout)
ORPHAN	A client waiting in queue has given up once it was offered a new session
CLIENT_STOPPED_SESSION	The session was stopped using an ordinary call to stop/quit on the client. Why are you using it again??
CLIENT_GONE	The client process (your code) appears to have died or otherwise not responded to our requests, intermittent network issues may also cause
FORWARDING_TO_NODE_FAILED	The hub was unable to forward to the node. Out of memory errors/node stability issues or network problems
CREATIONFAILED	The node failed to create the browser. This can typically happen when there are environmental/configuration problems on the node. Try using the node directly to track problem.
PROXY_REREGISTRATION	The session has been discarded because the node has re-registered on the grid (in mid-test)
